## Course Projects

Throughout this course, I had the opportunity to work on three exciting projects, each demonstrating different aspects of data analytics. Here's a brief overview of each project:

### Project 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- **Location:** Part 4 – EDA Exploratory Data Analysis/module 20 - Exploratory Data Analysis II
- **Description:** In this project, I conducted an exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Jupyter Notebook. The dataset consisted of sales data for video games. I analyzed and visualized the data to uncover insights and trends. The final deliverable included a Google Slides presentation with a maximum of 7 slides. Each slide featured up to 2 graphics, accompanied by concise explanations (3-4 lines). The presentation concluded with key findings and insights.

### Project 2: Supermarket Sales Analysis

- **Location:** Part 10 - Non-relational databases and project part 2/module 40 - Exploratory data analysis with SQL
- **Description:** In this project, I delved into supermarket sales data using DBeaver(SQL). The dataset contained sales information for a supermarket. I performed data analysis to extract valuable insights. As part of the project, I created a presentation comprising up to 6 slides in Google Slides. The presentation highlighted and explained the analyses conducted.

### Project 3: Cloud Analytics in AWS

- **Location:** Part 13 -  Cloud Analytics in AWS
- **Description:** In the Cloud Analytics project, I set up a simple Data Lake in AWS, utilizing a CSV file stored in an S3 bucket. I performed ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations and connected to the data. My analysis included SQL commands for exploratory data analysis and Python scripting. To conclude, I created a dynamic dashboard with storytelling elements using Google Data Studio to communicate the project's insights effectively.

These projects allowed me to apply the skills and knowledge gained throughout the course, providing practical experience in data analysis and visualization.
